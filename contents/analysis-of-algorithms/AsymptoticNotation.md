# Asymptotic notation
Asymptotic notation is used to express time and space complexity

## Big-O notation
Big-O notation denotes the **upper bound** on the size of a function. 
- Big-O bounds can be overestimates

## Big-Ω notation
Big-Ω (Omega) notation denotes the **lower bound** on the size of a function.
- Big-Ω can be underestimates

## Big-Θ notation
Big-Θ (Theta) notation means the the bound is both Big-O and Big-Ω at the same time
- i.e both an upper bound and a lower bound
- Implies bound given is precise, not an overestimate or underestimate
