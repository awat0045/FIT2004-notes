# Recurrence relations
A recurrence relation is an equation that defines a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of the previous terms

## Master Theorem
Master theorem is a theorem that allows us to solve recurrence relations easily. Below is a worked example demonstrating the steps of applying master theorem on a given recurrence relation.
